trunic
======

trunic is a Go module for producing images of text written in the writing system from the game [Tunic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tunic_\(video_game\)).

The rune line data and bitmask system were taken from [Arayan Pingle's excellent in-browser translator tool](https://github.com/aryanpingle/Runic).
